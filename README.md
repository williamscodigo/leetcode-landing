# LeetCode Landing Page Clone

## Description

This is a clone of the current [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) landing page as of **October 8, 2025**. The goal of this project is to practice and improve my core frontend development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

In this project, I focused on:

- Recreating the modern layout and design of LeetCode's homepage
- Practicing responsive design techniques
- Strengthening my understanding of DOM manipulation and basic interactivity
- Matching UI elements and fonts closely to the real site

This project is purely educational and not affiliated with LeetCode.
